A profitable TV network
A TV network has n minutes of advertising time to sell during a prime-time show. The network can sell the time in various slot lengths, with each slot length having a corresponding price that advertisers are willing to pay. Given n (total advertising time), a list of lengths of possible slot lengths, and a list prices of what advertisers pay for each slot, determine the maximum revenue the network can make by selling the n minutes. For example, with n = 10, lengths = [3,5,7] and prices = [8,15,20], the maximum revenue is 30 dollars by selling two 5-minute slots. Use dynamic programming to find the optimal slot combination for maximum revenue.
